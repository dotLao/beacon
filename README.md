### Framework of App

*A* **Beacon** *is defined as* :
   * *A fire or light set up in a high or prominent position as a warning, signal or celebration*

Our **Beacon** is a hub for connecting potentially suicidal individuals with a blend of:
* responsive artificial intelligence 
* volunteers
* practitioners 

The flow of the escalation system will be :
**Initial AI Landing -> Volunteer Network -> Professional Practitioner -> EMS**

Our escalation system will push the user through tiers of support, depending on the severity of suicidal ideation. Throught every tier, the goal will be a combination of de-escallation and monitoring. If EMS needs to be alerted, along the way, then that will be possible through the app at every escalation stage.

We believe this app could develop a longer reach than traditional suicide prevention efforts, and offer a more comfortable medium for individuals to start the discussion; **a computer program.** 

The primary focus would be to de-escalate individuals, and connect them with follow-up services. Alternately, the individual can be pushed through the escalation system, culminating in an alert to EMS.

Current solutions in market are lacking in efficiency and ability.
